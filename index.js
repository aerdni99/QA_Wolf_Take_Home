  This script opens a chromium browser and goes to Hacker News.

  My objective is to make sure that the 100 entries that pop up on the page are indeed sorted from newest to oldest.
  I'll need to access the elements on the page and whatever attribute determines their age, then do some easy checks to see that each one is older than the last.

  // go to Hacker News
